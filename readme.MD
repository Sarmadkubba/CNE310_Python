# New project for python practice 
Using the python example for this assignment 


This is a code block:
``` 

number_grade = input("Enter your grade here")

letter_grade = "F"

# your code here
def calc_average(total):
    return total/4

def determine_letter_grade(grade):
    if 90 <= grade <= 100:
         A
    elif 80 <= grade <= 89:
         B
    elif 70 <= grade <= 79:
         C
    elif 60 <= grade <= 69:
         D
    else:
         F
```
